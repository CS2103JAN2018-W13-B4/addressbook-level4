== Introduction

PrioriTask is for those who *prefer to use a desktop application for keeping track of their tasks and priorities*. More importantly, PrioriTask is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI)* while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, PrioriTask can get your tasks and priorities organised faster than traditional GUI apps. Interested? Jump to <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version `1.8.0_60` or later installed in your Computer.
+
[NOTE]
Having any Java 8 version is not enough. +
This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
+
.  Download the latest `organizer.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your PrioriTask.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
+

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* `list` : lists all tasks
* `add n/CS2103T Developer Guide p/10 d/2018-03-02` : adds a task named `CS2103T Developer Guide` to the PrioriTask.
* `delete 3` : deletes the 3rd task shown in the current list
* `exit` : exits the application

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.
