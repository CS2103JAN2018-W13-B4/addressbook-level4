== Introduction

Organizer is for those who *prefer to use a desktop app for keeping track of their tasks and priorities*. More importantly, Organizer is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, Organizer can get your tasks and priorities organised faster than traditional GUI apps. Interested? Jump to the Section 2, “Quick Start” to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version `1.8.0_60` or later installed in your Computer.
+
[NOTE]
Having any Java 8 version is not enough. +
This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
+
.  [.line-through]#Download the latest `addressbook.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].# _{ to be edited accordingly soon ... }_
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Organizer.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
